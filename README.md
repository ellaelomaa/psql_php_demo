A simple demo made with PSQL, PHP, Python and JQuery. The demo was coded with VSCode and hosted on a local server with XAMPP. PgAdmin4 was used for database management. On the (XAMPP-hosted) webpage the user
can sort results by various attributes, either in ascending or descending order. The user can also choose up to three genres to filter the movies, and use the textbox to query movie titles.
